\chapter*{Abstract}

The use of neural network-based models for approximation has proven to be highly
effective across various domains. In this thesis, we demonstrate the universal
approximation property of two-layer neural networks (\gls{2nn}s), which allows
them to approximate any continuous function on a compact subset in $\R^d$
uniformly well. Additionally, we explore the class of functions that meet a
smoothness constraint on their Fourier transform and can be effectively
approximated by 2NNs. These functions belong to the Fourier-analytic Barron
spaces, which we characterize. We then introduce the concept of infinite-width
Barron spaces, where any function can be approximated well by 2NNs through an
integral representation. Finally, we draw connections between these spaces and
provide a comparative analysis of their properties.
