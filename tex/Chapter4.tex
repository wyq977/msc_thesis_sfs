\chapter{Summary and Future Work}

In this thesis, we study the approximation properties of two-layer neural
networks with different activation functions.

In chapter \ref{ch:preliminary}, we summarize the result from $n$-term approximation
theory and answer the question of density regarding 2NN. 


There remains some interesting problems to investigate in the future:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CoD
    \item Varitaion space
    \item 
\end{itemize}
