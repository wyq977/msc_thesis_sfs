\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Sara van de
Geer for giving me the opportunity to work on this interesting topic and the
frequent discussions. I have been very hesitant and afraid over the topic
selection at the beginning and I don't think I could put it through without her
support. The project familiarize me with functional analysis and some metric
spaces, and topology. I can really see my progress and maturity in mathematic
statistics. 

I would also like to thank Haiyu Chen for the inspiring discussions. I would
like Dr. Andre Richter for therapy sessions, which keeps my morale high.

Finally, I am grateful for my parents, my girlfriend Peiying Cai, and my friends
for their emotional support when I got stuck, which happens quite a lot during
the past months. This work would not have been possible without all the support
from them. Thank you.
