\chapter{Explicit Regularization}

Much progress has been made in recent years in the estimation of the population risk of the population risk, specifically under explicit regularization.
Though numerical experiments has well documented \TOCITE the behavior that deep neural networks model and shallow neural neural model are ``biased'' or ``skewed'' towards 
a more regularized, smooth output without explicitly setting regularization in the form of explicit penalty term or through various 
optimization techniques such as drop-outs, weight decay, etc.

In the case of explicit regularization,
